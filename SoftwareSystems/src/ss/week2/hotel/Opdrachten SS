method covered the most was open with everything green but yellow asserts.
least covered was activate with the if statement yellow, 1 of 4 branches missed.

This is because one of the combinations was not covered, probably the one where
an active safe tries to get activated with incorrect password.

It is a problem that some classes get covered 0% because it means they were not
tested at all.

I tried to add more tests to activate but none seemed to get the last branch.

-ea means that it runs the java program with the asserts, and throws an error when
a precondition is not met.

The first run had no errors because it ran without checking the asserts, the second
run did give an error because it checked the assert statements.
