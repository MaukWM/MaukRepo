What is included in JavaDoc are all the source files with their JavaDoc comments formatted
in a way that is easy to follow. Opening up Guest.java that was made previously shows
a short description with version number and author. Underneath that you find the 
Constructor summary, which shows the constructor and the linked comment. After that the
method summary, showing all methods with their comments. After that there is a more detailed
viewing showing what a method Returns and Parameters if included and a more detailed
explanation.

This is very useful because it allows you to keep track of your project in a good to follow
way, and one can immediately see what specific methods do without having to go through the
code themselves.
